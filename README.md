# Design and Evaluation of AR-HUD Elements at Night for Autonomous Vehicles in VR

This project contains a VR autonomous driving simulator to view AR-HUD elements driving autonomously at night on country roads.

This project was developed in context of my bachelor thesis at the University of Regensburg (Chair for Media Informatics).


## Idea
Based on related work, I designed four AR-HUD elements in VR with the help of Unity 2021.3.1f1 and Blender. 
The intention was to research which AR-HUD element was preferred by users driving at night on country roads.
The AR-HUD elements can be classified within two categories. The elements could be either world- or screen related or have different levels of abstraction.

## AR-HUD elements
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Categories</th>
    <th>Screen related</th>
    <th>World related</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Abstraction level 1</th>
    <td><img width = "700em" src="/docs/abstraction_1_screen_fix.png"></td>
    <td><img width = "700em" src="/docs/abstraction_1_world_fix.png"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Abstraction level 2</th>
    <td><img width = "700em" src="/docs/abstraction_2_screen_fix.png"></td>
    <td><img width = "700em" src="/docs/abstraction_2_world_fix.png"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Results
As a result of my study most of the participants prefer the world related abstraction level 1 AR-HUD element, closely followed by the screen related abstraction level 1 element.
The AR-HUD element which is the least favorite is the screen related abstraction level 2 AR-HUD element.
